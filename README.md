MLChem is a Python library designed to facilitate the investigation molecular potential energy surfaces with machine learning.

This project is very young and under active development.

Anticipated features include:

* Data Generation for Electronic Structure Theory Software
    * Generalized input file construction over geometrical configuration spaces
    * Generalized output file parsing of energies and gradients 

* Automated Data Transformation  
    * Rotation, translation, and permutation invariant molecular geometry representations
    * Various featurization methods 

* Local Machine Learning Algorithms
    * Neural networks 
    * Gaussian process regression
    * Kernel ridge regression

* Interfaces to External Machine Learning Algorithms

* Hyperparameter optimization


This project is a collaboration with the [Molecular Sciences Software Institute](molssi.org).
