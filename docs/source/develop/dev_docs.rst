*The following are ideas for future PES-Learn development*

Feature Ideas:
- Using PES-Learn to compute trajectories of PES's
- Add more sampling methods
- Scale up to global PES to look at conformers
- Add GPU support
- Add threading with PyTorch
- Add more transformations other than Morse transforms 
- Use the surface as a program to find features such as global minima (e.g. with gradient descent)
- User specified hyperparameter optimization bounds
- User designed models
- Interactive graphing
- Include data reduction keyword
- Index training and test set corresponding to original PES.dat 
- Diabatization incorporation (e.g. DDNN of Truhlar)
- Active learning for larger systems
- Prune Sobol' sampling to prevent bunched up data points
