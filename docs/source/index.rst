Welcome to PES-Learn's documentation!
=====================================

**PES-Learn** is  a Python library designed to fit system-specific Born-Oppenheimer 
potential energy surfaces using modern machine learning models. PES-Learn assists in 
generating datasets, and features Gaussian process, neural network, and kernel ridge regression
model optimization routines. The goal is to provide high-performance models for a given dataset 
*without* requiring user expertise in machine learning. 

This project is under active development and welcomes community suggestions and contributions.
