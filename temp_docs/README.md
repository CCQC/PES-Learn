# Compiling PESLearn's Documentation

The docs for this project are built with Sphinx. To compile the docs, first ensure that Sphinx and the ReadTheDocs theme are installed.

```
conda install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme 
```

Once installed, you can use the Makefile in this directory to compile static HTML pages by

```
make html
```

The compiled docs will be in the _build directory and can be viewed by opening index.html (which may itself be inside a directory called html/ depending on what version of Sphinx is installed).
